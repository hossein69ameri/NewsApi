# Architectures
![alt - Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amitshekhariitbhu/MVVM-Architecture-Android/master/assets/mvvm-arch.png)

**View** : Activity/Fragment with UI-specific logics only.

**ViewModel** : It keeps the logic away from View layer, provides data streams for UI and handle user interactions

**Model** :  Repository pattern, data layers that provide interface to manipulate data from both the local and remote data sources. The local data sources will serve as single source of truth
